<h1>The Best Movies According to Sam</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mad Max</h3>
<p>
Max has an awesome car and is out for blood! Early Mel Gibson was a badass, but not as much lately.  He's gone a little cray-cray.
</p>
<h3>Gallipoli</h3>
<p>
Also starring Mel Gibson, but that's not the reason I like this movie.  This is a movie about young boys exploring friendships as they enlist in the Austrialian Army during World War I and ship off to Turkey to ultimately fight in Gallipoli.

<h3>Am√©lie</h3>
<p>An artistic movie filmed in French that explores many different character personalities and has a very sweet character arc.
